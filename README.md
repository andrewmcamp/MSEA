# MSEA Tutoring

This repository contains files and resources developed for tutoring sessions for students in the MSEA program at the UArk.
Some files are heavily adapted from [Scott Cunningham](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300251685/causal-inference) and [Nick C. Huntington-Klein's](https://www.routledge.com/The-Effect-An-Introduction-to-Research-Design-and-Causality/Huntington-Klein/p/book/9781032125787#) excellent methods books/accompanying files.

## Tutoring Sign-Up
1:1 Tutoring or a meeting specifically with your research team is available on Monday and Wednesday from 4-6pm. Appointments are required at least 24 hours in advance to make sure I'm on campus and available.

There are two steps to set up a tutoring appointment:
1. **[Reserve a room at Mullins Library.](https://uark.libcal.com/reserve)** We can also meet via Zoom or elsewhere on campus if you'd prefer.
2. **[Sign-up for a tutoring appointment here.](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/MSEATutoring@uark.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/)**

## Optional Large Group Sessions
The other component of tutoring will be weekly large-group sessions lasting 1-2 hours. In each session, we'll review content you've recently covered in class or work through practical coding exercises.
