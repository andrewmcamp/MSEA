## Tutoring Sign-Up
1:1 Tutoring or a meeting specifically with your research team is available on Monday and Wednesday from 4-6pm. Appointments are required at least 24 hours in advance to make sure I'm on campus and available.

There are two steps to set up a tutoring appointment:
1. **Reserve a space.** Mullins Library Study Rooms are easy to reserve and usually work very well. [You can reserve a room online here.](https://uark.libcal.com/reserve) We can meet somewhere else on campus if you'd prefer.
2. **[Sign-up for a tutoring appointment here.](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/MSEATutoring@uark.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/)**
